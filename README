RepRap Minihost

The RepRap Minihost is a control and g-code file transmitter 
for RepRap 3D printers.
The program is written in C++ using the Qt and boost library.
At the moment you cannot use the newes boost library version.
For me it works with 1.40, 1.44 does not work. Live with that 
or suggest a patch ;) I will take care of this as soon as
possible.

First run
$ qmake -project
and edit the created .pro file. Add the libs line or 
correct it so that it looks like this one:

LIBS += -lboost_system -lboost_regex

Then run
$ qmake
$ make
